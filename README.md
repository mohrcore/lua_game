Lua Course Project (game)
=========================

Cool game I guess.

Left/right to move player instances
Z to split

Collect as many stars as you can and reach finish line

Holes will kill you if you fall into them.
Walls will kill you if you collide with them, and they will prevent you from moving to sides
Arrows will move you one tile to a direction they point
